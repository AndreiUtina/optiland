# Optiland

## Introduction
Optiland is a lens design and analysis program written in Python 3. It provides an intuitive and efficient interface for defining and visualizing lens systems, performing optimization of lens systems based on user-defined merit functions and variables, as well as analyzing optical systems using geometric and diffraction-based methods.

I would like to reference the excellent work of https://github.com/Sterncat/opticspy and https://github.com/jordens/rayopt, as I drew inspiration from both projects.

## Functionalities
- Lens entry, 2D visualization, paraxial analysis, real and paraxial ray tracing (including aspherics), real analysis functions (spot diagrams, ray aberration fans, OPD fans, distortion, MTF, etc.), glass catalogue and index/abbe v-number determination (many thanks to refractiveindex.info), design optimization, tolerancing, wavefront and zernike analysis, coating analysis, and more. The code itself is in constant flux and new functionalities are always being added.

## Getting Started
The best way to get started with this software is to check out the several Jupyter notebook located in this repository. A good start is *Basic_Functions_Tutorial.ipynb*.
