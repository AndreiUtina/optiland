## [0.1.0] - 2024-09-07
 
- Initial release of the Optiland package.
- Optiland is a lens design and analysis program written in Python 3. It provides an intuitive and efficient interface for defining and visualizing lens systems, performing optimization of lens systems based on user-defined merit functions and variables, as well as analyzing optical systems using geometric and diffraction-based methods. Leveraging computational libraries such as NumPy and SciPy, Optiland delivers exceptional performance and efficiency in handling complex optical computations.
