Optiland File Format
====================

File Format: `.json`
--------------------

Optiland uses a `.json` file format to store and load optical system definitions. This format ensures:

- **Interoperability**: Easily share and transfer systems between Optiland users.
- **Human-Readable**: Clear structure for easy manual edits or review.
- **Extensibility**: Accommodates additional parameters as the software evolves.

The `.json` files encode the configuration of the `Optic` class, including all surfaces, fields, wavelengths, and settings,
ensuring reproducibility of simulations and analyses.
