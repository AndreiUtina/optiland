Visualization Framework
=======================

Visualization in Optiland is modular, with each component of the optical system rendered independently. Features include:

- **2D and 3D Renderings**: Visualize optical components and ray paths in multiple dimensions.
- **Component Views**: Individual rendering of surfaces, rays, and apertures.
- **System Views**: Full-system visualizations for understanding overall behavior.

This modular approach ensures flexibility and extensibility for custom visualization needs.
