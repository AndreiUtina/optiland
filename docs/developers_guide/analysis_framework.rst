Analysis Framework
==================

Optiland's analysis framework provides a suite of tools for evaluating system performance, including:

- **Spot Diagrams**: Visualization of image quality based on ray intersections.
- **Ray Fans**: Evaluate system aberrations across field angles.
- **Pupil Aberrations**: Analyze wavefront error in the entrance or exit pupil.

These tools work seamlessly with the `Optic` class and take advantage of the ray tracing framework for accurate results.
