Optimization
============

This section covers the optimization functionality of the Optiland package. The optimization module 
provides a set of tools for optimizing optical systems. It includes a variety of optimization algorithms, 
such as gradient-based and evolutionary algorithms, as well as tools for defining optimization variables 
and objectives.

The optimization module is divided into three subcategories:

1. Optimization Core Functionalities
2. Optimization Operands
3. Optimization Variables

Core Functionalities
--------------------

   optimization.optimization


Operands
--------

The `optimization.operand` subpackage contains the following modules:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:

   optimization/operand/*

Variables
---------

The `optimization.variable` subpackage contains the following modules:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:

   optimization/variable/*
